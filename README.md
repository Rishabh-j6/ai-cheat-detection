# 🎯 AI-Powered Exam Cheat Detection

An AI-driven exam platform that enhances academic integrity by detecting cheating behavior in both online and offline environments — featuring a **live cheat health bar** and tab-switch tracking.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Basic (Implemented)
- **Tab Switch Detection** – Tracks tab switching to flag suspicious activity
- **Live Health Bar** – Visually shows the level of cheating suspicion in real-time (0% to 100%)

### 🌟 Innovative Ideas (Planned)
- **Audio Detection (Offline)** – Detects voice/chat via local microphone input
- **Multimodal AI** – Combines head movement + timing patterns per student
- **Cheating Health Score** – Live score that changes color and triggers warnings
- **Voice Pattern Classifier** – Whisper/Vosk integration to detect suspicious speech
- **Behavioral Analysis** – Face direction, eye tracking via OpenCV/MediaPipe

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

**AI Modules (Planned):**
- Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Whisper
- TensorFlow / PyTorch for AI model integration

**Backend (Future):**
- Node.js / Flask / Django (for API & AI)
- MongoDB / PostgreSQL (for storage)

**DevOps:**
- Git & GitHub for version control
- GitHub Pages / Render for deployment

## 📂 How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
3. Switch tabs and watch the health bar rise!  
4. Customize the detection logic in `exam.js`

## 📌 To-Do (Next Rounds)

- [ ] Add camera & mic access for CV/audio detection  
- [ ] Train basic behavior classification model  
- [ ] Store cheat logs per student  
- [ ] Admin dashboard to monitor multiple students
